        <p>The nav element represents a location on a page that links to other pages or to parts within a page. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of contents, and indexes. A nav element is typically found near the top of every web page on a site, because this is where the user expects it to be.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section2">
        <h2>Section 2 content</h2>
        <p>A web page can contain several nav elements. For example, one for site navigation and one for navigation of elements on the same page. Use of more than one nav element on the page is usually only necessary in complex Â½websites with large amounts of information to structure.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="section3">
        <h2>Section 3 content</h2>
        <p>Note though that not all groups of links on a page need to be in a nav element - Only sections that consist of major navigation blocks are appropriate for the nav element. For example, a footer may contain a list of links that don't need to be in a nav element.</p>
